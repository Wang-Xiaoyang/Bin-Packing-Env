# Bin-Packing-Env

OpenAI gym style environments for bin packing problems. 


## bpp_2d - 2D bin packing environment

**what is this env doing**  
    2D bin packing with a single bin.     
    Generate *N* items; pack them into a bin.  
    The solution with the minimal bin size will get the highest reward.  
    Items are generated by slicing a 'bin' with size [W, H].  
    
**state**  
    2D representation of the bin + items.  
    Dimension is *(N+1) * bin_width * bin_height*.  
    
**actions**  
    Choose an item; find a position to place this item.  
    Action space: *N * bin_width * bin_height*  

**reward**  
    get the minimal bin [w', h'] from packing result  
    if the game is not finished: reward = 0  
    if the game is finished: reward = (total area of items) / (max([w', h'])^2)  
    *users can define their own reward!*  
    
**rules for place an item in the bin**  
    item(s) must be adjacent to either the boarder of the bin or other items in two adjacent directions (e.g., left and up, left and down, right and up, right and down). Basically, an item can't be floating in the air.  
    This rule is defined in *./bpp_2d/gym-2d/gym_bpp_2d/envs/BinPackingLogic.py*, function *get_adjacency()*. Users can specify their own rules by modifying this function.
